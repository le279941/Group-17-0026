A Florida health insurance company wants to predict annual claims for individual clients. The company pulls a random sample of 100 customers. The owner wishes to charge an actuarially fair premium to ensure a normal rate of return. The owner collects all of their current customer's health care expenses from the last year and compares them with what is known about each customer's plan.

The data on the 100 customers in the sample is as follows:

-   Charges: Total medical expenses for a particular insurance plan (in dollars)
-   Age: Age of the primary beneficiary
-   BMI: Primary beneficiary's body mass index (kg/m2)
-   Female: Primary beneficiary's birth sex (0 = Male, 1 = Female)
-   Children: Number of children covered by health insurance plan (includes other dependents as well)
-   Smoker: Indicator if primary beneficiary is a smoker (0 = non-smoker, 1 = smoker)
-   Cities: Dummy variables for each city with the default being Sanford

Answer the following questions using complete sentences and attach all output, plots, etc. within this report.

```{r dataset, include=FALSE}
Insurance_Data_Group16 <- read_csv("~/GitHub/ECO6416_Group16/Data/Insurance_Data_Group16.csv")
View(Insurance_Data_Group16)
```

## Question 1

Generate this regression equation:

$$Charges = \beta_{0}+\beta_{1}*Age+\beta_{2}*BMI+\beta_{3}*Children + \beta_{4}*Female + \beta_{5}*Smoker + \beta_{6}*WinterSprings + \beta_{7}*WinterPark + \beta_{8}*Oviedo$$

```{r q1}
model <- lm(Charges ~ Age + BMI + Children + Female + Smoker + WinterSprings + WinterPark + Oviedo, data= Insurance_Data_Group16)
summary(model)
```

Which independent variables test significant in a two-tailed test? Use $\alpha = 0.2$

```{r q1b}
p_values <- summary(model)$coefficients[, 4]
significant_vars <- names(p_values[p_values < 0.2])
significant_vars <- significant_vars[significant_vars != "(Intercept)"]
print(significant_vars)
```

## Question 2

Interpret the coefficients of all the independent variables that tested significant.

```{r q2}
## For every one-year increase in Age, the Charges increase by approximately $261.95, holding all other variables constant.
## Being a smoker increases the Charges by approximately $24,221.46 compared to a non-smoker, holding all other variables constant.
```

## Question 3

The insurance agent returns with another client:

-   Age: 35
-   BMI: 26
-   Children: 1
-   Gender: Female
-   Smoker: No
-   City: Sanford

Using the regression equation above, predict the amount of medical expenses associated with this policy. (Provide a 95% confidence interval as well)

```{r q3}
newdata <- data.frame(Age = 35, BMI = 26, Children = 1, Female = 1, Smoker = 0, WinterSprings = 0, WinterPark = 0, Oviedo = 0)
predicted_value <- predict(model, newdata = newdata, interval = "confidence", level = 0.95)
print(predicted_value)

point_pred <- predicted_value[1, "fit"]
lower_limit <- predicted_value[1, "lwr"]
upper_limit <- predicted_value[1, "upr"]

cat("The amount of medical expenses associated with this policy is", point_pred, ".\n")
cat("The 95% confidence interval is [", lower_limit, ", ", upper_limit, "].\n")
```

## Question 4

Compare the model from question 1, to a model that does not include the group of city dummies. Does including the cities reduce the SSE by a statistically significant amount? (check the partial F-test for significance of the dummies as a group). Use $\alpha = 0.05$

```{r q4}
## Running a Reduced Model
reduced_insurance <- Insurance_Data_Group16[,-(7:9)]
model_reduced <- lm(Charges ~ ., data=reduced_insurance)
alpha <- 0.05
summary(model_reduced)

## Comparing the model from Q1 with this reduced model
anova_comparison <- anova(model_reduced, model)

f_statistic <- anova_comparison$F[2] # Extracting the F-statistic value for the full model
p_value <- anova_comparison$`Pr(>F)`[2] # Extracting the p-value for the F-statistic

cat("We used the ANOVA test to compare the full model (with the group of city dummies) and the reduced model (without the city dummies). The F-statistic comparing the full model to the reduced model is", f_statistic, "with a p-value of", p_value, ". ", "This determines that including the cities as a group does not significantly reduce SSE. The p-value is not significant.")
```
